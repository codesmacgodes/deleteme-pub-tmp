# deleteme-pub-tmp
Please disregard; empty public repo to be deleted no later than 2022-07-15

Granting write access to an external user on a public repository requires that they
have a license, but the "... We've created a fork ..." option happens automatically
from the edit (pencil icon) button. The fork was created before I even saved a change.

With no obvious prompting, the branch "patch-1" was created in (other user)/deleteme-pub-tmp.
This writing (re: patch-1) was the second commit on the branch.
