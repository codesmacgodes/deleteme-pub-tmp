# deleteme-pub-tmp
Please disregard; empty public repo to be deleted no later than 2022-07-15

Granting write access to an external user requires getting them a license, but
the "... We've created a fork ..." option happens automatically from the edit
(pencil icon) button. The fork was created before I even saved a change.

With no obvious prompting, the branch "patch-1" was created in (other user)/deleteme-pub-tmp.
Now it's got two commits because I just wrote this note.
