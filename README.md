# deleteme-pub-tmp
Please disregard; empty public repo to be deleted no later than 2022-07-15.
This is a fork of that deleted repository.

This repository was first created as a public repository owned by an GitHub Enterprise 
organization to demonstrate that a license is still required for direct participation
by an external user, and that a fork + pull request interaction is always available. The
"... We've created a fork ..." option happens automatically from the edit (pencil icon) button.
The forked repository is created before I even save a change.

With no obvious prompting, the branch "patch-1" was created in (other user)/deleteme-pub-tmp.
This writing (re: patch-1) was the second commit on the branch.

Once the original was deleted, the fork is of course unaffected (although the
"Fork" has a "0" on it, which is simply accurate). Naturally the first commit by
the organization member is unchanged, and there never was mention of the org name
in the code or commit notes.
